    <!--? 1:How do you create a paragraph using the <p> tag? -->
    <!--? 2: Can you nest other HTML elements inside a <p> tag? -->
    <!--! No, the <p> tag is a block-level element, and it cannot contain block-level elements like other paragraphs or headings. However, you can include inline elements like <strong>, <em>, and links. </em></strong>
